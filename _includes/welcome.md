### Organization of this document

The purpose of this document is to show you by example how to create a nimbella project and use the main platform features to build a stateful cloud application. We'll use a set of tutorials to give you a feel for the various types of projects you can create.

The examples used in this document are available on GitHub in these tutorials and the Nimbella platform has integrations with GitHub to make it easy to deploy your projects from GitHub, as you'll see.

Here's how this document is organized:
